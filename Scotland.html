    <h3>Dresses of Scotland</h3><button class="btn-btn-info" id="tpg"  onclick="traditional()" style="margin-left: 80%; margin-bottom: 2%;" >home</button>
    <p>The traditional dress of Scotland is called Highland dress. It is the regional dress of the Highlands and Isles of Scotland, and is often characterized by tartan (plaid in North America). Specific designs of shirt, jacket, bodice and headwear may also be worn along with clan badges and other devices indicating family and heritage.<br> Men’s Highland dress typically includes a kilt or trews of his clan tartan, along with either a tartan full plaid, fly plaid, or short belted plaid. There are a number of accessories, which may include but are not limited to: a belt, sporran, sgian-dubh, knee-socks with a cuff known as kilt hose, garters, kilt pins and clan badges.<br> Women’s Highland dress is also based on the clan tartan, either that of her birth clan or, if married, that of her spouse’s clan if she so chooses.<br> Traditionally, women and girls do not wear kilts but may wear ankle-length tartan skirts, along with a color-coordinated blouse and vest. A tartan earasaid, sash or tonnag (smaller shawl) may also be worn, usually pinned with a brooch, sometimes with a clan badge or other family or cultural motif. Modern Highland dress can be worn casually, or worn as formal wear to white tie and black tie occasions, especially at ceilidhs and weddings</p>
