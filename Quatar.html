    <h3>Traditional dress of Qatar</h3><button class="btn-btn-info" id="tpg"  onclick="traditional()" style="margin-left: 80%; margin-bottom: 2%;" >home</button>
    <p>Qatar has a rich cultural history and strong Islamic influence, which shape local customs, laws, and dress. Traditional fabrics, head dresses, and detailed embroidery combine to create a unique display of color, harmony, and faith.</p><p> In Qatar, clothing is not only necessary but also a form of modesty, religious commitment, and a display of traditional values.</p>

    <p>The traditional dress for Qatari men is a thobe, a long white shirt over loose pants. This traditional garment features long sleeves that reach to the wrists and typically stops at the ankles. A ghutrah or keffiyeh is commonly worn by men in Qatar and is a form of traditional headdress. The ghutrah is typically made from a square scarf that is placed on the head and secured with a cord. The most common colors of a ghutrah are white and red and white chequered. An agal is a double black cord that is commonly used to secure the ghutrah. This cord was traditionally made from goats hair, but today is often made of synthetic materials. A bisht is a cloak that is worn over a thobe and is typically worn by Qatari men for special occasions or by clergy, chiefs, and kings. It typically comes in three colors: black, white, and brown. Detailed embroidery is often seen on the edges of the garment and typically consists of gold, silver, or silk.
