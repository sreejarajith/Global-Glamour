    <h3>Traditional clothing in chile</h3><button class="btn-btn-info" id="tpg"  onclick="traditional()">home</button>

    <p>Traditional clothing in Chile is very festive and convenient at the same time. It is usually made of natural materials. Women’s attire is rather feminine and men’s costume is very masculine. Chilean national clothing is bright and, embellished with embroidery and colorful ribbons. The origin of the traditional costume of Chile historically is very old, but Spanish and Portuguese national clothing (which belongs to a much later time) had a great influence on the formation of Chilean traditional costume. So, today Chilean national clothing is a great mix of old natural handmade fabrics and modern style and cut.<br>

        The most important traditional Chilean clothing for women is the vestido de huasa, or the huasa dress, which is usually worn for cueca dancing. With the huasa or cueca dress, the silhouette is key. (Think rockabilly Chilean cowgirl.) Though there are many styles of traditional dresses, all are characterized by a tight, cinched-in waist and a wide, full skirt which falls just below the knees. Many dresses include a sash around the waist and incorporate a floral pattern. Although these huasa or cueca dresses can be any color, you often see them in red, blue or white, the colors of the Chilean flag. In addition to this traditional dress, there’s also a more elegant huasa dress, usually for older women, which features a long, black skirt that fits close on the legs, hitting the ankles and includes a red sash and a bolero jacket.<br>
        
        For men, the most important traditional Chilean clothing is the chamanto or poncho, a straw hat called a chupalla, and riding trousers. The chamanto is a kind of poncho, but both sides of chamanto (inside and outside – light and dark) can be used. Usually, people use the dark side during the day and the light side at night. This piece of clothing, as well as a poncho, is very convenient, warm and beautiful. Often it has bright embroidery and a fringe. Chileans also wear long and wide cowboy trousers. They can be made from leather or cotton. Cowboy trousers are often embellished with fringe and other decorative elements. Safari jackets are less widespread than chamantos but still popular. It is a more modern piece. It is a light weight cotton, drill or poplin jacket, dyed in khaki color. It has a lot of pockets. Safari jackets are very convenient, that’s why they became so popular.</p>
