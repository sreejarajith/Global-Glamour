<body><h3>Dress of Uganda</h3><button class="btn-btn-info" id="tpg"  onclick="traditional()" style="margin-left: 80%; margin-bottom: 2%;" >home</button>

<p>Uganda has a rich cultural heritage, and traditional clothing is an important part of it. The country doesn’t have one particular national attire, but each Ugandan belongs to a tribe hailing from different regions of the country, and all these tribes have traditional outfits that distinguish them from one another. Here are some of the traditional outfits worn during traditional ceremonies such as introduction parties, giveaways, coronation ceremonies, and many others where it’s improper to dress up in casual clothes:<br>

  Kanzu: This masculine outfit looks similar to a tunic and is mostly composed of a white or cream fabric. It’s made from silk, cotton, poplin, or linen. Linen kanzus are the most expensive. The Kanzu unlike other specific attires cuts across several tribes and almost all Ugandan men wear it during cultural functions. The Kanzu has a make of a dress and the men usually wear trousers beneath it plus a coat over their shoulders to match with it.<br>

  Gomesi/Busuuti: This is the traditional dress for Baganda and Basoga women. It is believed that this dress existed way back before missionaries and Indians arrived in Uganda. The first Gomesi was made of bark cloth however today they come in materials such as silk, cotton, and other fabrics. It’s a long dress that sweeps the ground with pointed outstanding, triangular-shoulder pads, and square neck. It has a large mass of clothing falling on one side around the hip area. A gomesi is not a single clothing but rather one that is accompanied with several garments to make it whole like the Kikoy which is an undergarment that is worn to add weight. The other Uganda clothing is the belt that is tied in a bow-form around the waist to hold the dress and all other internal accessories together.<br>
  Omushanana: This is a female wear that has its roots in Rwanda and is usually won by the women from the western part of the country. It’s a three-layer garment with a mini top usually a vest won over a wrapper skirt and shawl tied around the shoulders.
  Suuti: This dress is also won by the women of western Uganda. It is very similar to the Omushanana except that the Omushanana has far more softer material than the suuti. Its common among the Banyakole, Bahima, and Batooro. However, unlike the gomesi, this particular wear is not meant to touch the ground but to rather be above it. </p>
