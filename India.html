                <p>Clothing in India varies with the different ethnicities, geography, climate, and
                cultural traditions of the people of each region of India. Historically, clothing has evolved from
                simple garments like kaupina, langota, achkan, lungi, sari, to rituals and dance performances. In urban
                areas, western clothing is common and uniformly worn by people of all social levels. India also has a
                great diversity in terms of weaves, fibers, colors, and the material of clothing. Sometimes, color codes
                are followed in clothing based on the religion and ritual concerned. The clothing in India also
                encompasses a wide variety of Indian embroidery, prints, handwork, embellishments, and styles of wearing
                clothes. A wide mix of Indian traditional clothing and western styles can be seen in India.</h3></p>

                                <p><h3>Saree</h3>A saree is a garment worn by women in the Indian subcontinent. It is an unstitched drape that ranges from 5 to 9 meters.
                                   It is draped around the waist with one, and the other end is draped over the shoulder. The waist remains partly bare.
                                    There are multiple styles in which a saree is draped. The history of draping saree dates back to the Indus Valley Civilization.<p>

                                  <p><h3>Lungi</h3> A Lungi is another traditional garment of India. A Mundu is a lungi, except that it is always white.It is eithertucked in, over the waist, up to knee-length, or is allowed to lie over and reach up to the ankle. It is usually tucked in when the person is working, in fields or workshops, and left open usually as a mark of respect, in worship places, or when the person is around dignitaries.

                                    Lungis, generally, are of two types: the open lungi and the stitched lungi. The open lungi is a plain sheet of cotton or silk, whereas the stitched one has both of its open ends stitched together to form a tube-like structure.</p>

                                <p><h3>Achkan</h3>Achkan is a small jacket that usually sports exposed buttons throughout the length of the jacket. The length is usually just at the knees and the jacket ends just below the knee. Achkan is very similar to the Sherwani which is a much longer coat-jacket dress. The jacket has a Nehru collar.[50] The Achkan was mostly worn with tight-fitting pants or trousers called churidars. Achkan is made from various fabrics for both formal and informal occasions. The achkan features traditional Indian embroidery like gota and badla. Achkan was commonly worn by the grooms during wedding ceremonies[51] or other formal festive occasions in the Indian subcontinent but when it evolved into the Nehru Jacket, the achkan became less worn.</p>

The Punjabi suit also includes the "churidaar" and "kurta" ensemble which is also popular in Southern India where it is known as the "churidaar".</p>

                        <p><h5>During the 1960s and 1970s, at the same time as Western fashion was absorbing elements of Indian dress, Indian fashion also began to actively absorb elements of Western dress.Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Western designers enthusiastically incorporated traditional Indian crafts, textiles and techniques in their work at the same time as Indian designers allowed the West to influence their work. By the turn of the 21st century, both Western and Indian clothing had intermingled creating a unique style of clothing for the typical urban Indian population. Women started wearing more comfortable clothing and exposure to international fashion led to a fusion of western and Indian styles of clothing. While women have the choice to wear either Western or traditional dress to work,most Indian multinational companies insist that male employees wear Western dress.

                            Women's clothing in India nowadays consists of both formal and casual wear such as gowns, pants, shirts, and tops. Traditional Indian clothing such as the kurti have been combined with jeans to form part of casual attire.Fashion designers in India have blended several elements of Indian traditional designs into conventional western wear to create a unique style of contemporary Indian fashion.</h5></p>
